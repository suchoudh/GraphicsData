# Nature is the ultimate wonder. 

## “Every creature was designed to serve a purpose. Learn from animals for they are there to teach you the way of life. There is a wealth of knowledge that is openly accessible in nature. Our ancestors knew this and embraced the natural cures found in the bosoms of the earth. Their classroom was nature. They studied the lessons to be learned from animals. Much of human behavior can be explained by watching the wild beasts around us. They are constantly teaching us things about ourselves and the way of the universe, but most people are too blind to watch and listen.”

“A trademark of something that works well, the cat body has hardly changed since its inception. Like with today's cats, their digestive systems could handle only flesh.

“Sonnet of Nature

What do the rivers do?
Give water for our thirst.
What do the trees do?
Give air for our lungs.
What do the animals do?
Give food for our tummy.
What do the flowers do?
Give fragrance for our body.
After taking everything,
From every member of nature,
What do we pompous idiots do?
Destroy all natural order.
It's high time to get our act together.
Nature doesn't need us, but we need her.”
